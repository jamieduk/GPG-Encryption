Passphrase to decrypt the included test file! (test.txt.gpg)

testpass123

dec.sh "test.txt.gpg"


to encrypt a file

./enc.sh "filename.ext"

Put in passphrase for both enc and dec!

Please Note:
(Pass will NOT be cached as the agent is killed for added security)

Here's an example of how to use symmetric encryption with GPG Manually:

Encrypting a file with GPG in symmetric mode:

gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 filename

This will prompt you to enter a passphrase, and it will create an encrypted file with the same name as the original file but with a .gpg extension.

Decrypting the file:

gpg --decrypt filename.gpg
